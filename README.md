Youtube video content creation in AR/VR

## Description

Many people are joining Youtube to be able to share their thoughts and ideas.

Soon after starting a Youtube account they'll realize they need for a nice camera, lighting, and a great place to film.

We attempt to build a tool which can be used to create Video Content in Augmented Reality. By doing this we can use virtual cameras, virtual lighting, and virtual sets saving the Content Creator money and time.
